Introduction
  - purpose : Exercises to become familiar with bit-level integer and floating-point representations
  
  
  
  - bit.c 
    : There are 15 programming problems 
    
    : You have to solve the integer problem without loop or if
    
    : Each problem has allowed operation ( 8 operations in most cases, ! ~ & ^ | + << >> ) 
    
    : Use only 8-bit or less integer

  - In this case you can use if, while
  
  - Arbitrary int and unsigned constants can be used, and int and unsigned data types can be used.
  
  - union, struct, and array cannot be used
  
  - All function arguments and return values are unsigned.




  -helper program
    : fshow = Shows the structure of floating-point numbers. You can see the bit pattern using fshow
    
    : ishow = Shows the structure of an int number.
