Report on the bomblab



Situation
  : Dr. Evil installed binary bomb on our server. Binary bomb is a program consisting of several phases, and a string suitable for the program must be input for each   phase. If an incorrect string is entered, “BOOM!!!” is printed and the bomb explodes and the program ends. There are so many bombs that students have to eliminate them one by one.
  
  
  
Scoring

  - 0.5 point deduction for each bomb detonation

  - Highest score: 70 points

  - The first 4 phases are worth 10 points each

  - Phase 5 & 6 are 15 points each


Defusing

  - If you do it with ./bomb , you type the string directly.

  - If it is executed with ./bomb solution.txt, it is executed by inputting each line entered in solution.txt as input.
